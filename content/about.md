I'm passionate about helping others and bringing awareness to missing people. I was missing a portal where the info could be found of such government or non-government agencies.

This website serves as a comprehensive directory of missing persons databases and organizations from around the world. My goal is to provide easy access to resources that can help locate missing individuals and support families in their search.

## How to Use This Site

- Browse by country using the navigation menu
- Each country page contains links to official missing persons databases and organizations
- All links open in new tabs for your convenience
- Website favicons are automatically displayed next to each link for easy visual identification

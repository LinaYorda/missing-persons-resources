Hello!

I'm Tsvetelina, and I've been involved in missing persons work for quite some time. I'm passionate about helping others and raising awareness about missing persons cases. I noticed there wasn't a centralized portal where people could easily find information about government and non-government agencies that handle missing persons cases. That's why I'm creating resources to help families and investigators access the information they need.

This website serves as a comprehensive directory of missing persons databases and organizations from around the world. My goal is to provide easy access to resources that can help locate missing individuals and support families in their search.
